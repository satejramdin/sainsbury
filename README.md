creening test Please complete the following task. The aim of the task is for you to demonstrate your grasp of key DevOps skills, such as working with source control, automation, orchestration and software configuration management. You should aim to have your results ready to share at least 24 hours prior to your interview.

a) Compile the following Go source code into a binary executable that can be deployed to a web server. The executable is a very basic HTTP server. You will need to download and install the Go compiler.

package main
import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
        "os"
)
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        h, _ := os.Hostname()
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I'm served from %s!", h)
}
func main() {
        http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
        http.ListenAndServe(":8484", nil)
}
b) Write some code you can use to create and launch 3 separate linux nodes using vagrant, packer, docker or any other tool of your choice:

2x application nodes
1x web node
c) Using a configuration management tool of your choice, e.g. Chef or Ansible:



Deploy the Go binary and run it on the application nodes
Install and configure Nginx on the web node so that requests are sent to the two application nodes in a round robin fashion.
You should demonstrate that the round-robin is working correctly.
We would like to be able to use your code to bring up the nodes with as little typing and hassle as possible. Your code should make it easy to troubleshoot any issues that arise during configuration and deployment.

d) Commit all your files to a public git repo of your choice, including a README.md with instructions on how to bring up the three nodes. Donâ€™t forget to include the hostname of the web node. When we send an http request to the load balancer we expect to see the following message: Hi there, I'm served from ! Bonus point: Compile and deploy the code as part of an automated build process.


Notes:- 
This was developed on Amazon Linux machines 
All code was hand written (apart from the 'host_file_update' cookbook - ,
consider forking and using the 'official' nginx, golang Chef repositories.
Chef-solo was used for testing the recipes - and is included in the repo.
The target OS is Amaon Linux, as it's the one I'm most used to (Amazon Linux equivilant). Many of the recipes are cross-family, by using 'package' as opposed to 'yum_package'. 
With more work, it could be completely cross-family (Linux platform - Debian/CentOS)
Both backend servers are referenced by static IP, but with some work, the nginx config template could be dynamically populated (either IPs or through DNS).

Install Chef yum install ruby-devel
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
gem install chef -v 11.18.12 --no-ri --no-rdoc
Clone this public git project 
cd to myapp
curl 172.31.16.95 Hi there, I'm served from 172.31.41.153
